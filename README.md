- Robust error handling and validation

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- MySQL (or your preferred relational database)

## Prerequisites
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine
- Maven for building the project
- MySQL database (or your preferred relational database) installed and running locally

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
